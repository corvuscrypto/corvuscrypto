        Hey there! First off, sorry for all the javascript bloat, but you know how things are these days; you just aren't
        a cool kid if you don't use JS. Hopefully some of the things I post here are helpful to other developers around
        the world. If you want to know more about my background I give a fairly brief write-up on the "About Me" page!
