    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p class="narrative">
      <img src="/static/images/logo_black.png" class="about__image pull-xs-left"/>
      Quite simply, I love what I do. All of what I do. This includes coding, of course.
      I was originally educated in biology and even went to grad school for it. Though I don't
      have a degree in CS, because of my chosen field learning algorithms and programming were
      a necessity. While I had learned to program in high school in various languages, being
      involved in scientific computing was very cool and I loved the small taste I got of
      bioinformatics. The challenges of handling large data sets of genomic data kept me thinking.
    </p>
    <p class="narrative">
      Alas, when I graduated from my university, I immediately entered into the master's graduate program.
      I look back and often feel this was my biggest life turning point. To spare the details, I
      will just say I got burned out and I dropped the program after a year.

      I certainly enjoyed my time and I learned a lot, but I felt a bit depressed from working in an
      academic setting for 12-14 hours a day and wanted a break.
    </p>
    <p class="narrative">
      With the free time I had, I had tried many new things. I went downhill mountain biking in Angelfire, NM,
      met up with old friends in Arizona, and even got my skydiving license in Rosharon, Texas at Skydive
      Spaceland (I'm still active btw and jump out of Skydive Elsinore)! After my partying was done, I decided
      to move out to southern California to try my hand at biosciences once again. I was saddened to find out
      <image src="/static/images/skydive_head.png" class="about__image round pull-xs-left"/>
      that while the businesses are certainly making money down here, not much of that is seen by scientific
      staff, save for a few senior-level scientists that made about $25/hr. I was able to find a job at a local
      Guitar Center that netted me about the same amount as I was making at the time ($10/hr) while working as
      a chemist for an environmental lab. With much more free time and fun I should add!
    </p>
    <p class="narrative">
      I decided that since I still was pretty strong in programming I would use my free time to get acquainted with
      the ins and outs of software development. It was tiring, but every week I was spending 2-4 hours a day learning
      a new algorithm from the classic Intro to Algorithms book, or learning the nuances of design patterns. Still,
      it was fun! There was always a new problem to solve and this is what I crave; problems! My first major project
      ended up being an altimeter, for which I developed the firmware. It worked well and I learned first hand the
      challenges of dealing with limited resources and picking algorithms optimized to both time and memory constraints.

      I still have it and it works well (I have personally tested it in the sky and I'm not dead!). After feeling
      confident enough, I started applying for software development positions to begin my new career. It was
      depressing at first how many companies required a computer science (CS) degree, but finally I was able to
      land a job at a financial company where I still work today. I learned quickly that regardless of my lack of formal
      CS education, I was able to fit into the field and also that the senior devs working for 10 years with CS master's degrees
      still used StackOverflow and Google for answers just like me!
    </p>
    <p class="narrative">
      Because of my experiences, I am a firm believer that you can learn anything and succeed in any career path given
      time and effort. However there is always more to learn and while I have a good job, I never stopped looking for
      more problems to solve. This is my passion and I'm glad to have found it!
